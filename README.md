# Virtual-Memory-Allocator
A C-based dynamic memory allocator, implementing custom malloc (vmalloc) and custom free (vmfree) functions. This project focuses on memory management, pointer arithmetic, bitwise operations, and heap organization, culminating in a shared object library (.so) for dynamic linking in other programs.
